### 😃 About

I always try to learn new things, and improve what I already know. 

_Scientia potentia est_ - _Knowledge is power_

I am interested in cryptocurrencies 💱 and dapps 🧾, and at the moment I am digging into Rust 🦀, Flutter 🐦 and Python 🐍 😄, but also improving my JavaScript/TypeScript frontend/backend knowledge 💪

I have a [personal website](https://mespin.vercel.app/) and a [Gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/marc2332).
